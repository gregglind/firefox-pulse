## Recorded Data

On Mozilla servers, record
- actions in the 'pulse' UI elements
- submitted ratings
- attributes of profile (addons, active minutes, some browser settings)
- a unique profile key, used only for this experiment

## What prompted Mozilla to run this test?

Mozilla wants to collect ongoing feedback to improve Firefox.  The
[Input](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/feedback) program has been insufficient to these needs.

As part of getting this right in the future, we want to understand how UI affects feedback.  This experiment looks at three aspect of ui:

- interruption context
- type of widget
- topic and phrasing of question

Data collected from this test will be used to inform many uncoming features relating to feedback, repair, and support.
