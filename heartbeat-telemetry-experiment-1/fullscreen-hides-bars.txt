Fullscreen hides bars:
- browser/base/content/browser.css

#main-window[inFullscreen] #global-notificationbox,
#main-window[inFullscreen] #high-priority-global-notificationbox {
  visibility: collapse;
}

browser/base/content/browser-fullScreen.js


1. I am not sure that I agree with this!

However, less than %1 of sessions are in fullscreen mode.

(Fullscreen is supposed to be presentation?  If so, let's call it that, and do:

#main-window[inPresentationMode] #global-notificationbox,
)

(or redesign presentation mode?)


Why devtools should care about presentation mode on all platforms:
- parity with chrome
- getting devs to present.
- ask Dan C. what is works and what can be expanded here.
- solution seems small and doable.
- good contributor project
